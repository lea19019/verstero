# Roadmap
- Built the UI
  - Get Icons and logos for the app
  - Create most of components you are going to use
    - Login: modify current view to something like in the nuxt app, remove the image and create some sort of musical animation
    - Sign In: pretty much the same as the login except that is for sign in 
    - Header: Create menu for when user is not logged in, and make current user menu only visible when user is logged in
    - Navs: Create correct navs and figure out how to create variables for routes and name pages
    - Song details page: this page should look super attractive and it should have a way to download the song stuff as an image, it should also have a way to share their songs through facebook, instagram, and twitter
    - Admin page: this will contain a reference to all the songs a user has created and some sort of form to create another song
    - Admin preference page: here user can change its password, delete its account, view its credit details
    - Payment page: here we need to connect with stripe to create a way for them to pay
    - Landing page: an overview of the app
    - Contact page: use some simple form to get feedback from user, should be available for logged in users too
    - About: a page to explain more in detail about the page and also to show off some stuff
    - Preview page: probably a page to show some popular songs, pretty much the same as the admin page but for the general public, it will link to a song details page of the free popular songs
