# Roadmap
- Built the UI
  - Create most of components you are going to use
    - Login: modify current view to something like in the nuxt app, remove the image and create some sort of musical animation
    - Sign In: pretty much the same as the login except that is for sign in 
    - Header: Create menu for when user is not logged in, and make current user menu only visible when user is logged in
    - Navs: Create correct navs and figure out how to create variables for routes and name pages
    - Song details page: this page should look super attractive and it should have a way to download the song stuff as an image, it should also have a way to share their songs through facebook, instagram, and twitter
    - Admin page: this will contain a reference to all the songs a user has created and some sort of form to create another song
    - Admin preference page: here user can change its password, delete its account, view its credit details
    - Payment page: here we need to connect with stripe to create a way for them to pay
    - Landing page: an overview of the app
    - Contact page: use some simple form to get feedback from user, should be available for logged in users too
    - About: a page to explain more in detail about the page and also to show off some stuff
    - Preview page: probably a page to show some popular songs, pretty much the same as the admin page but for the general public, it will link to a song details page of the free popular songs
  - Get Icons and logos for the app


  TODO: Understand how to pass parameters to firebase cloud functions, apperantly you need to send a RequestData object, no idea how that looks...



# Flow

Users will typically land in the landing page, it will contain a brief presentation of what the page is about and top 5 songs of spotify plus 5 random songs of my playlist
They'll be able to download the song description along side with an AI generated image
There will be a button to "generate a new song", if user is not logged in it will be redirected to the signup page, once the user is logged in then it will be possible for him to generate a song
The user should have a page where to view all of his generated songs
And a page to generate a new one, alongside with a view to see the generated song

When searching for a song I'll use the spotify api to find the actual song, maybe get the lyrics if they exists
Seems Like i will also need to create at some point some sort of song lyrics scrapper

Probably for now, the beta is just create a simple form, pass the name of the song and artist and let gpt figure out the rest. I'll probably need to add this in another step, after the intial project is complete.

- Create the models 

- Create users and authenticate them
- Then define the model for the songs and the users
- Add form to generate song pero user
- Display them according to the user
- Add form so to search data based off spotify
- Add way to find lyrics and use them in search

```ts
interface User {
  username: string
  bio: string
}
interface Song {
  name: string
  artist: string[]
  album: string
  imageCover: string
  previewUrl: string
  trackId: string // From Spotify
  interpretation: string
  language: string
}
interface User_Song {
  id: userId_song_id
  userId: string
  songId: string
  name: string
  artis: string
  imageCover: string
}
```
# Roadmap
1. Connect to actual firebase and not emulator, make the firebase functions also connect to firebase instead of using the emulator.
2. When ever user is created guide the user to also create a username and add an image. (Use fireship tutorial as guide)
3. Create/update the current [username] route to be redirected as its own page (Search on svelte docs for this)
4. Add form to generate a song interpretation on users page (Modify the current code)
5. Update firebase functions to generate song interpretations and also save all the data on its corresponding collections (Probably self research to investigate this)
6. Display as a list the generated songs of a X user
7. Modify the songs page to display all the songs generated by all users
8. Make it so that when a user enters the url of a user then it displays the list of all generated songs by that user
... // Probably more things I'll have to sold during the development of the above
-2. Create the spotify searcher bar.
-1.5. Create a view display of the results
-1. Create a functionality to search for a song on the headers search bar
-1. Display list of songs that matches
-1. If song has interpretations display those
-1. If it doesn't and user is not logged in prompt user to login to generate an interpretation if it is just let him generate the interpretation
-1. Scrape for the lyrics in the web to use them in the generator.
0. Maybe create some sort of questionary to know about the user music taste, likes, etc. to use them in their song interpretation generator
+1. Add stripe and money things
+2. Handle security

Create a path for the users view page, this view will contain the list of songs that user has contributed with.
If user is logged in it will also contain a form to let you generate the interpretation of another song

Anybody will be able to see the generated song interpretation
